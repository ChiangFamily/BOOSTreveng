# BOOSTreveng
Reverse engineering the LEGO BOOST Hub. I'm interested in using Linux (and MINDSTORMS EV3 with ev3dev) but information might be usefull  to everybody.

Will document my findings here.

LEGO and BOOST are Trademarks from The LEGO Company, which doesn not support (probably even know about) this project.
And of course I'm not responsible for any damage on your LEGO BOOST Hub.
